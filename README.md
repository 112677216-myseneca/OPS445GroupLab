## Game Design

Our iteration of Rock, Paper, Scissors works by prompting the user to select either rock, paper or scissors. After the user selects their choice, the script will run and choose which option the game will use. Based on the chosen options, the script will inform the user if they won or lost. It will then prompt the user to choose if they would like to play again by selecting yes or no, after which the script will loop.
